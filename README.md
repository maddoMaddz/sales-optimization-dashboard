# 📊 Sales Optimization Dashboard

This project showcases a Tableau-powered dashboard and strategic analysis for optimizing pricing, marketing, and sales performance. Developed as part of the *Data Visualization* course at Hult International Business School, the analysis identifies product-level profitability patterns, seasonal sales cycles, regional revenue gaps, and the limited impact of discounting on long-term growth.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Tables**: High sales but negative profit margins → cost/pricing problem  
- **Accessories & Chairs**: High profit, low sales → need targeted promotion 
- **Seasonality**: Q4 delivers consistent revenue spikes → prep for inventory & marketing  
- **Discounting**: Weak correlation with profit (R² = 0.112, p = 0.188) → not reliable  
- **Geography**: States like Texas & California generate revenue but low profit → revisit pricing

**Short-Term (0–6 months)**  
- Reduce blanket discounting on low-margin items  
- Launch geo-targeted marketing in underperforming states  
- Promote loyalty programs during Q1 to smooth seasonality dips  

**Mid-to-Long-Term (6–12+ months)**  
- Develop regional pricing strategies
